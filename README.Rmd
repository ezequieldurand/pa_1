```{r}
dur_hablo_stressed <- 0.4285
dur_hablo_unstressed <- 0.425
dur_o_stressed <- 0.96
dur_o_unstressed <- 0.095
int_o_stressed <- 75.45650746885987
int_o_unstressed <- 77.70875119537644
f0_o_stressed <- 130.86138657317088 
f0_o_unstressed <- 161.7074516572704


dur_hablo_stressed - dur_hablo_unstressed
dur_o_stressed - dur_o_unstressed
int_o_unstressed - int_o_stressed
f0_o_unstressed - f0_o_stressed

```

I can see that in my recording, the duration of both hablÃ³ and the Ã³ is longer than for the unstressed conditions. This seems to be the opposite for f0 and intensity, for which the unstressed conditions are greater than the stressed conditions.
